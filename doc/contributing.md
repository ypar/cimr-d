# Contributing data with a yaml file


_cimr-d_ uses a version control system, [git](https://github.com), to
track different versions of code and data. Experienced git users
may skip the following section and just move on to the
[example yaml files](#examples).

In order to contribute new data to _cimr-d_, please follow these steps:



### 0. Make a github account.

Create a GitHub [account](https://github.com), GitHub allows
unlimited public repositories, and also offers
[discounts for academics](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new).

If you need more detailed guides, here is
[a tutorial on using git and github for revision control](https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/tutorials/tutorials/using_git/Using_Git/).

In order to contribute data to cimr-d, you also need a local
installation of git.
[Here is a guideline for installing git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).



### 1. Prepare data

Details are in the following
[section](#preparing-a-file-for-data-contribution).

Here is an example GWAS file:

```
rsnum	variant_id	pvalue	effect_size	odds_ratio	standard_error	zscore	tss_distance	effect_allele	non_effect_allele	frequency	imputation_status	sample_size	n_cases	build
rs12565286	chr1_785910_G_C_b38	0.06295	-0.03250	NA	0.01940	-1.85954	NA	C	G	0.05628	original	54632	NA	b38
```

Any variant-based association files can be similarly formatted.
The file must be tab-delimited. Accepted file extensions included
`tsv.gz` and `txt.gz`.

The absolute minimum requirement for _cimr-d_ to accept the
contributed data are following columns:

* variant_id
  (in the format of chrom_position_ref-allele_alt-allele_genome-build)
* pvalue
* effect_size
* standard_error
* effect_allele
* sample_size (in the yaml file)
* n_cases (in the yaml file)
* build (in the yaml file)


We strongly recommend that the file(s) be uploaded to an archive
service such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org). This ensures that all
steps involving processing and remapping of the files are reproducible
by others. In rare cases, we may accept Google Drive share links,
provided that the cimr-d processed outputs can be publicly shared.



### 2. Prepare the contributor yaml file

Some more details are provided
[below](#writing-a-yaml-file-for-data-contribution).

You may write your own yaml files or copy a
[template](#template-yaml-file) and fill in values.

Recommended indentation for yaml files are 4-spaces per level.
While most other columns in the example files are not required,
it is highly recommended that the contributor provide as much
information as they have available to maximize the usage of
contributed data.

Find the hyperlink to the file uploaded in [step 1](#prepare-data)
and paste in `url` field of the yaml file.



### 3. Fork cimr-d repository.

Here is
[a help article](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo).



### 4. Commit yaml file

Once the repository has been forked, clone the repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:${your-github-user-name-or-organization}/cimr-d.git
```

Then place the prepared yaml file from
[step 3](#fork-cimr-d-repository) in the `submitted` dir.

```bash
cd cimr-d
cp ${path-to-the-prepared-yaml-file} submitted/
```

Next, add and commit the file.

```bash
git add submitted/${yaml-file-name}
git commit -m '${short-meaningful-message-about-data}'
```

Now the file is ready to be submitted to cimr-d.



### 5. Create a pull request from the forked repository

Here is
[a help article](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

Each yaml file may refer to one compressed text file or multiple
compressed text files in a tar archive. For one yaml file to
be used to submit multiple data files, the information in the
yaml file must be representative of all submitted files.

Alternatively, one cimr-d pull request may be filed with multiple
yaml files at once; i.e. one or more appropriately formatted
yaml files can be placed in the `submitted` directory
as described in [step4](#commit-yaml-file) for one pull request.


-------------

# Preparing a file for data contribution

## File formatting

Currently _cimr-d_ expects tab-delimited plain text files that
are compressed by gzip. Column headings may differ from the
default _cimr-d_ example files. However, in such cases,
column heading changes must be noted in the
[yaml file](#conditionally-required-fields).



# Writing a yaml file for data contribution


## Accepted weblinks

_cimr-d_ accepts data previously uploaded to public archives such as
[zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) and [figshare](https://figshare.com/).
_cimr-d_ will work as long as the linked data contains all required
columns and properly formatted yaml pointing to it.

However, we strongly recommend archive services in place of e.g.
personal storage drive or box accounts, due to various reasons
including long-term reproducibility and contributor acknowledgement.



## Required fields

Following keys are required for _cimr-d_ processing:

```yaml
data_file:
    location:
        url: https://location.of.contributed.data
        md5: md5sum-hash-for-file

data_info:
    citation: doi-number
    data_type: data-type
    context: tissue-or-trait
    build: genome-build
    sample_size: sample-size
    n_cases: n-cases
    can_be_public: true

method:
    name: method-name
    tool: tool-name
    website: tool-reference

```



## Conditionally required fields

`columns` fields in `data_file` are required if the submitted data
contains column names different from the default _cimr_ variables.
See [data_file section](#data_file) for available options.



## Optional fields

For most non-required fields [as seen in examples below](#examples),
`na` (as in `not available`) is an acceptable value. Alternatively,
if there's no information available for a given non-required field,
such variables may be omitted.


## Basics on yaml file formatting

Example cimr submission files are provided [below](#examples).
[YAML refers to a human friendly data serialization standard](https://yaml.org/).
Detailed documentation can be found
[here](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html).

YAML uses strict syntactically significant newlines and indentations.
In case of cimr data-submission yaml form, most fields expect values
of one word or a short string (such as a website link). However, for
longer lines as in `data_file: description`, multi-line strings can be
indicated with `>-` next to the key as shown in
[an example](#gwas-upload-yaml-file-example).



## Missing values

Missing values in the yaml file may be indicated by `na` or by
deleting the key from the yaml file.



## Listing multiple values

Multiple values may be listed for keys in `data_info` and `method`
sections. These values can be separated using a `;` (semicolon) between
values.





# Keys


## data_file

`data_file` key is a superset of keys describing the dataset.
Both of the `location` keys are required to contribute data to
_cimr-d_.

## data_info

Data information provided in `data_info` is used to generate citation
and metadata information used for analyses and acknowledgements.


| argument      | description                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| citation      | publication or data doi, if applicable               |
| context       | context of the submitted data                        |
| data_source   | (permenant) link to the original data, if applicable |

| n_cases       | number of cases, if applicable (e.g. binary trait)   |
| data_type     | data_type (e.g. twas, gwas, eqtl, etc.)              |
| can_be_public | whether the data can be posted publicly via cimr-d   |


### citation

While not required, citation information ensures that data contributed
to _cimr-d_ are acknowledged and cited properly as they are used in
other research studies. DOI numbers can be provided from published paper
describing the data or from zenodo and other data archive services.
Multiple doi's may be listed with `;` delimiter. e.g.

```yaml
data_info:
    citation: 10.5281/zenodo.3369410;10.1038/ng.2797
```


### context

`context` in `data_info` refer to the context of the contributed data
in the biological sense. For instance, for `gwas` `data_type`, `context`
will mean complex traits or diseases used in the study. Recommended
`context` values include terms searchable in
[Human Disease Ontology](http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/doid.html)
such as terms from the
[NCI Thesaurus](https://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/). An example
`context` for `gwas` would be
[coronary artery disease](http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/DOID?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_3393).

For `eqtl`, the `context` may be the tissue or cell type within
which the eqtl effect has been measured. Recommended `context` values
include terms from the
[Uber-anatomy ontology](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/uberon).
For the GTEx example [provided below](#eqtl-upload-yaml-file-example),
the `context` is `whole blood`, which is a synonym with `blood`
in [uberon](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/uberon/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FUBERON_0000178).

This information is used to assess compatibility between datasets for
meta-analysis and other downstream applications. Values in `context`
will be changed to all lower case letters and an `_` (underscore) will
be inserted in place of spaces for consistency in the
[catalog.txt](https://github.com/greenelab/cimr-d/blob/master/catalog.txt).



## method

Method details can be listed here.

| argument  | description                       |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| name      | name of the method used           |
| tool      | name of the tool used             |
| website   | website link(s) for the tool used |

If multiple methods and tools are used to generate data, they
may be listed, separated by a `;` (semicolon).

```yaml
method:
    method: mixed effects model
    tool: GEMMA;BOLTLMM
    website: https://github.com/genetics-statistics/GEMMA;https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/BOLT-LMM/
```


## contributor

Contributor information is optional but recommended.


| argument    | description                         |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| name        | name of the contributor             |
| github      | github user name of the contributor |
| email       | e-mail address of the contributor   |

## eQTL upload yaml file example


Here is an example yaml file for eQTL data submission. It
refers to a file linked on a website, GTEx Portal. Since the file
contains all required columns for _cimr-d_ but has different
column names, this information has been noted in the `data_file`
section of the yaml file.



```yaml
data_file:
    description: >-

## GWAS bulk upload yaml file example

_cimr-d_ allows bulk uploads, if all data contributed share metadata.
Specifically, compressed tarfiles are accepted. Bulk file extensions
can be: 'tar.gz', 'tgz', 'tar.bz2', or 'tar.xz'.

For instance, two different traits, low-density lipid cholesterol and
high-density lipid cholesterol, have been measured in the same
cohort of people and analyzed using the same method in the below
example. In this case, two compressed tab-delimited files may be
prepared as one tarfile and submitted with one yaml file.



```yaml
data_file:
    description: >-
        Global Lipid Genetics Consortium GWAS results for high-density
        cholesterol levels
    location:
        url: https://zenodo.org/record/3345991/files/gwas_hdl_ldl.tar.gz

## GWAS upload yaml file example using a Google Drive link


For single compressed text files submissions, _cimr-d_ will accept
a Google Drive link in place of an archive service such as
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org). Additional requirement for a Google
Drive link is an pre-defined file name `input_name` field in the
`data_file` section to overwrite the hashed file path.

An example yaml file is provided below:


```yaml
data_file:
    description: >-
        Global Lipid Genetics Consortium GWAS results for triglyceride
        levels
    location:
        url: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dpCqxjZRZtWmiq_6GalCLTweFd15y09n/view?usp=sharing
        md5: 9935f0422c52f32946629dd1f965af51
    input_name: glgc_triglycerides.txt.gz
    columns:
        variant_id: panel_variant_id
        variant_chrom: chromosome
        variant_pos: position

# Frequently asked questions


## Where did my data go after submission to cimr-d?

Successfully processed data will be relocated to a publicly
accesible S3 bucket in Amazon Web Services (AWS).
[The list is maintained in the cimr-d github repository](https://github.com/greenelab/cimr-d/blob/master/processed/README.md)
for convenient review and download. Periodically, data will
undergo additional review to be released on an archive service
such as [zenodo](https://zenodo.org) to allow bulk downloads.


## What happens after I submit a pull request with new data?

_cimr-d_ is based on a continuous integration service,
[CircleCI](https://circleci.com). Once a pull request with a
new yaml file is opened, it will go through the cimr-d pipeline for
automated file checking, processing and ID harmonizations before
data is accepted for storage in _cimr-d_. One may check the status
of the automated steps by the colored dots next to the PR commit
history in the GitHub. Orange means the PR has been submitted and
is pending processing. Green means the PR has passed all
pre-requisites to proceed into the _cimr-d_ AWS S3 bucket for
public downloads. Once the PR has been checked, both the submitted
and processed data are manually reviewed before the PR is approved.
Subsequently, data merged into the master branch will be relocated
to a designated S3 bucket for public downloads.


## How long does it take for the PR to be approved?

_cimr-d_ processing depends on the size of the data. A typical data
containing $\leq$ 10 million lines would take a few minutes or less.
Larger files (e.g. $\geq$ 150 million lines) may take a significantly
longer time due to I/O limits. An example eqtl scan results file from the
Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), for instance, may take about an hour.

Additionally, in order to make sure all data processed are suitable for
_cimr-d_ release, the resulting processed dataset(s) are manually reviewed
before the PR is approved. We try to provide feedback for changes or
approve the PR within one or two business days.


## I got an error message in the cimr log, what does it mean exactly?


Troubleshooting cimr-d processing based on error messages:


`data type is not recognized`
* Currently _cimr-d_ expects variant-based association data.
  These can be genome-wide association study (gwas) results or
  expression-, splicing-, protein-, and other quantitative trait
  loci (eqtl, sqtl, pqtl, etc.). These data types should be
  indicated by the `data_type` field in the
  [yaml file data_info section](#data_info).


`%s rows in %s are non-numeric' % (numcol, col,)`
* variant_pos, inc_Afrq, effect_size, standard_error, zscore,
  pvalues, frequency, ma_samples, maf and tss_distance columns
  are expected to only contain numeric values.
* By default the following values are interpreted as NaN: ‘’,
  ‘#N/A’, ‘#N/A N/A’, ‘#NA’, ‘-1.#IND’, ‘-1.#QNAN’, ‘-NaN’,
  ‘-nan’, ‘1.#IND’, ‘1.#QNAN’, ‘N/A’, ‘NA’, ‘NULL’, ‘NaN’,
  ‘n/a’, ‘nan’, ‘null’.


`the format of %s is not testable.' % (col,)`
* cimr will try to test whether above mentioned numeric columns
  containing non-numeric values can be converted into numeric.
  If this test fails, it will cause a format error.


`unknown delimiter used in variant_id`
* Expected variant_id format is:
  chromosome_genomicposition_referenceallele_alternateallele_genomebuild
  with underscores. cimr-d will accept ":" and "-" delimiters and
  convert them to underscores while processing. Any other delimiters or
  missing information may cause an error.


`chromosome id needs to be checked.`
* chromosome ID contains values other than \[chr\]1-26, X, Y, M or MT.
* data is too big to be processed as a whole. Split chunks of data
  do not contain all chromosomes (benign)


`there are no matching rs ids`
* By default a random subset of variants are selected to check against
  the reference genomic position - rs id pairs. If this test fails,
  cimr-d will cause an error.


`{col} should only contain values between 0 and 1`
* pvalue column containing non-probability values will cause an error.


`feature_id column is not provided`
* eqtl, sqtl, pqtl, etc. datasets must contain a column specifying the
  tested feature for each variant.


`variant_id column is not provided`
* variant_id column should contain unique variant ids in the format
  of chrom_pos_refallele_altallele_genomebuild.
  e.g. chr1_13417_C_CGAGA_b37


`rsnum column is not provided`
* rsnum column is recommended but _cimr_ will still run as long as
  `variant_id` and other required columns are provided.


`effect_size column is not provided`
* effect size (beta coefficient, regression coefficient, etc.) values
  are required to submit data to _cimr_.


`standard_error column is not provided`
* standard errors of the effect size are also required.


`pvalue column is not provided`
* pvalue column is required.


`file {self.outfile} cannot be written`
* The output file could not be written. It likely is caused by
  directory permission issues.


`no content in {self.file_name}`
* The file is empty.


`check your data_type`
* Indicated data type is not a recognized data type.


`check the file link and try again`
* The weblink provided in the yaml file is not available.


`data_type not indicated in dir tree`
* For `data_type` == `multiple`, the dir tree must reflect the
  `data_type` of compressed tsv files in each dir.


`{yaml_file} is not accessible`
* cimr is not able to access the yaml file for processing.


`there is no data_type indicated`
* `data_type` field is empty.
